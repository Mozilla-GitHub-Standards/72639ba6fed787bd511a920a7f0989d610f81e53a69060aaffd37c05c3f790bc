  <h1>Sync Spray</h1>

  <p>Use this page to simulate browser activity. This will spray Sync with
     events. This in turn can be thought of as a load test for the browser
     and Sync.</p>

  <p><strong>This page will disrupt your existing browser session and profile
     state! You should probably only consider using with a profile you don't
     care about!</strong></p>

  <h2>Start Browsing Simulation</h2>

  <p>Enter a URL in the box below to begin browsing. This will open new tabs
     and mess with your bookmarks.</p>
